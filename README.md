### **What Are Commands and What Is TPY?**

#### **Commands**

Commands are the building blocks of every bot created on TBC. A command is triggered when a user sends a specific keyword or message to the bot (e.g., `/start` or `/help`). These commands dictate the bot's response and behavior. Each command must have an associated code written in **TPY**.

Example:

```python
bot.sendMessage("Hello! This is the /start command.")
```

Commands can:

* Respond to user inputs.
* Perform actions like sending messages, images, or files.
* Interact with APIs, manage user data, and much more.

#### **TPY (Telebot Python)**

TPY is a customized version of Python developed specifically for Telebot Creator. It provides an extensive set of built-in tools, libraries, and pre-defined variables to streamline bot development.

Features of TPY:

* **Pre-Defined Libraries**: Includes integrations for payments (Coinbase, Paytm), blockchain transactions (Polygon, TTcoin), randomization, and more.
* **Security and Simplicity**: A restricted execution environment ensures safe code while keeping it simple for developers.
* **Command Management**: Enables chaining, scheduling, and advanced user interactions through `runCommand`, `runCommandAfter`, and `handleNextCommand`.
